Requirements for Food Ordering Restaurant Website

Project Overview

This project is a food ordering restaurant website inspired by Swiggy's UI. The platform will include a main UI with two distinct user roles:

Normal Users – Can browse the menu, place orders, and track deliveries.

Restaurants – Will have a separate dashboard to manage their menu, track orders, analyze earnings, and manage reviews.

General Guidelines

Smooth Animations: Implement floating animations, hover effects, and dynamic transitions.

Fully Responsive: Ensure the website adapts perfectly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Engaging Media Elements: Use multiple images, carousels, and background visuals for an enhanced look.

Preloader & Load Transitions: Include a stylish preloader and smooth page transitions.
